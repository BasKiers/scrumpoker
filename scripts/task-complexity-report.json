      "taskTitle": "Create Shared Types Package",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the shared types package implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Core interfaces definition, 2) WebSocket event types and type guards, 3) State update utility functions, 4) Package configuration and export setup",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating TypeScript interfaces and utility functions that will be shared between frontend and backend. The complexity is moderate as it requires careful type definitions and ensuring compatibility across projects. The existing 3 subtasks cover most needs but adding package configuration would be beneficial."

      "taskTitle": "Setup React Frontend Project",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the React frontend setup into subtasks covering: 1) Project initialization with Vite, 2) TypeScript configuration, 3) Folder structure and routing setup, 4) Essential component scaffolding, 5) Cloudflare Pages deployment configuration",
      "reasoning": "Setting up a React project has moderate complexity due to configuration requirements, but is well-documented with established patterns. The current 4 subtasks are good, but adding a dedicated subtask for testing setup would improve completeness."

      "taskTitle": "Implement DurableObject with WebSocket Hibernation",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the DurableObject implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Basic Worker setup, 2) DurableObject class implementation, 3) WebSocket connection handling, 4) State management and persistence, 5) Event processing logic, 6) Hibernation and reconnection handling",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity as it involves Cloudflare Workers, DurableObjects, WebSocket management, and state persistence. The hibernation feature adds significant complexity. The current 5 subtasks are good but adding a dedicated subtask for testing and error handling would be valuable."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Room UI with Story Point Cards",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Room UI implementation into subtasks covering: 1) RoomPage component structure, 2) StoryPointCard component with selection functionality, 3) ParticipantsTable component, 4) Room control buttons and actions, 5) UI state management and integration with WebSocket data",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating multiple interactive UI components with state management. The complexity comes from ensuring components work together and properly reflect the room state. The current 4 subtasks are good, but adding a dedicated subtask for integration with WebSocket data would improve completeness."

      "taskTitle": "Implement WebSocket Connection in Frontend",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the WebSocket implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Basic connection establishment, 2) Message handling and parsing, 3) State synchronization with UI components, 4) Reconnection and error handling, 5) Event sending functionality with queuing",
      "reasoning": "WebSocket implementation is complex due to connection management, state synchronization, and handling network issues. The current 4 subtasks cover most needs, but adding a dedicated subtask for testing WebSocket functionality would improve reliability."

      "taskTitle": "Implement User Identification and Name Setting",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the user identification implementation into subtasks covering: 1) localStorage utilities for user ID generation and persistence, 2) Name input modal component with validation, 3) Integration with room state and WebSocket communication",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity involving local storage, form validation, and integration with the WebSocket connection. The current 3 subtasks appropriately cover the necessary implementation areas."

    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Card Reveal and Auto-Reveal Logic",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the card reveal implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Backend event handling for manual card reveals, 2) Auto-reveal logic based on participant selection status, 3) Frontend UI updates for card reveal states, 4) Animation and transition effects for card reveals",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both backend and frontend logic with state synchronization. The complexity comes from ensuring the auto-reveal logic works correctly across all clients. The current 3 subtasks cover most needs, but adding a dedicated subtask for animations would improve the user experience."
